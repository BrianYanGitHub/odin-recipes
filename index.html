    <h1>Thing's I've made so far</h1>
    <p>This is my first stab at making a website, so I thought I would make a recipe website detailing 
        all the food I've made this past year. Below is a list with their respective recipes. Enjoy!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="recipes/cheesecake.html">Cheesecake</a></li>
        <li><a href="recipes/ChickenNoodleSoup.html">Chicken Noodle Soup</a></li>
        <li><a href="recipes/DakJuk.html">DakJuk</a></li>

    </ul>
