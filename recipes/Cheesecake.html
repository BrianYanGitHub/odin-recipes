    <h1>Cheesecake</h1>
        <p>I remember the first time I had cheesecake. My cousin Howard had just baked us one and 
        everyone in the family <em>loved</em> it. An unsuspecting favorite amongst my asian family
        whose palette leans toward the blander side of things. As asians say, "Not too sweet" is 
        the greatest cake compliment. The following recipe takes inspiration from 
        <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/classic-cheesecake/">Sally's Baking Recipe</a>.   
        </p>
    <h2>What you need</h2>
        <p><em>Note: I'm using 1/4 of the ingredients from Sally's recipe above since my premade crust is very shallow. Adjust accordingly.</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>mixer</li>
            <li>baking pan large enough to house cake crust</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.keebler.com/en/sweet-treat/pie-crusts/graham/graham-cracker-crust-low-fat">9 inch Graham Cracker Crust</a></li>
            <li> 8 oz of cream cheese. Feel free to use low fat </li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 egg.</li>
            <li><em>optional. 1/4 tsp of Pure Vanilla Extra</em></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make sure eggs, cream cheese and sour cream are at room temperature</strong> This will ensure that they will
                    mix easy therefore preventing excessive mixing which ultimately leads to air bubbles and cracks in the cake.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
            <li>Preboil a pot of water for water bath. You will use this in step 7.</li>
            <li>Using the paddle attachment on the mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar on medium until the mixture is smooth and creamy. 
                Make sure to scrape off the sides of the bowl from time to time to get the stubborn chunks.</li>
            <li>Repeat step 4 with sour cream. </li>
            <li>Add the egg until its fully blended. Stop mixer. Pour batter into cake crust</li>
            <li>Place cake crust into baking pan. Fill baking pan with boil water from step 3 until water covers half the height of the crust.
                This prevents any cracking in the cake.</li>
            <li>Wait 20 minutes. When crust is starting to brown, it is almost ready. Check whether the batter is settled by wiggling the edge of the crust. If the crust jiggles alot on the circumference, it is not ready. 
                If its a very slight jiggle in the middle, it is perfect. </li>
            <li>Take out to cool to room temperature before freezing overnight</li>

        </ol>
